# Psychic Game

The main objective of this project was to create a game that utilizes Javascript, and using the interactive features that keeps track of the points, user key strokes, and having the computer randomize a guess.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites
We'll be using JQuery so it is important to remember to link to your HTML below your title tags------> <script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
Visual Studio Code(or any code editor) 
You can find the coding used for the porfolio at via:  https://github.com/jessicahuynh19/game/blob/master/psychic.html see the deployed webite via:

### Installing

When you have accessed the repository page on GitHub, you may simply download a Zip file and extract it to a directory of your choosing. Alternatively, you may download the data directly to your device via GitBash or Terminal if you have an SSH key. More on adding an SSH key can be found here: https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.15/user/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account

To download via GitBash/Terminal, once you have a working SSH key with GitHub, create a folder you wish to download data into. Next, click on the green 'Download or Clone' button on the GitHub respoitory page. Make sure you have SSH key selected(and not HTTPS), and click on the clipboard icon. This copies the address to your clipboard. Personally, I use SSH key but if you'd rather use HTTPS here is a link that will instruct you on using HTTPS over SSH https://help.github.com/en/articles/which-remote-url-should-i-use

Next, navigate to the folder you wish to download the data into via GitBash or Terminal, and then simply type "git clone" followed by the SSH or the HTTPS URL. Press the enter key, and GitBash/Terminal will pull the entire repository needed.


## Tips
W3Schools is a very useful database used to further explain code with examples, if you find yourself stuck I highly reccomend checking these two links out.
